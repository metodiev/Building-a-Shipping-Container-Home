# Drainage System for a Shipping Container Home

Proper drainage is one of the most important steps when building a shipping container home.  
Good drainage prevents:
- Foundation sinking  
- Water accumulation around the container  
- Rust and corrosion of the steel  
- Mold, moisture, and interior humidity  
- Soil erosion  

This guide explains how to design and build the drainage system step-by-step.


#  1. Understanding Why Drainage Is Critical

Shipping containers are steel structures.  
Standing water around the base can cause:
- Rust at the bottom rails
- Movement of the foundation supports
- Flooding under the container
- Mosquitoes and pests
- Long-term structural damage

A proper drainage system ensures **all water flows away** from the container and foundation.



# 2. Drainage System Overview

A good drainage system has 4 components:

1. **Site grading (slope the land away from the container)**  
2. **Perimeter gravel trench**  
3. **French drain (optional but recommended)**  
4. **Rainwater management (gutters + barrel or drain lines)**  

Below is a basic diagram:

#  3. Step 1 — Grade the Land (Slope the Surface)

You must create a slight slope **away from the container**.

### ✔ Recommended slope:
- **2–5% grade**  
  (= 2–5 cm drop per meter)

### Steps:
1. Mark a rectangle around your future container footprint.
2. Determine the highest and lowest points.
3. Use a shovel, rake, or mini-excavator to shape the slope.
4. Compact the soil with a **plate compactor**.

This ensures water never pools under the container.



#  4. Step 2 — Dig a Perimeter Drainage Trench

A trench around the container keeps water moving away.

###  Recommended trench size:
- **Width:** 30–40 cm  
- **Depth:** 30–60 cm  
- **Distance from container:** 30–50 cm  

### Steps:
1. Mark a path around the container footprint.
2. Dig the trench with a shovel or mini-excavator.
3. Make sure the trench slopes **downhill** (2–5%).

###  Materials you’ll need:
- Landscape fabric (geotextile)
- Crushed gravel / stones
- Perforated drainage pipe (optional)



#  5. Step 3 — Install a French Drain (Recommended)

A French drain is a pipe that collects and redirects water.

###  You should install one if:
- Your soil is clay
- Your land holds water
- You live in a rainy climate

###  Materials:
- 100 mm (4 in) perforated pipe
- Gravel
- Geotextile fabric
- Shovel / mini-excavator

###  Steps:
1. Lay **geotextile fabric** inside the trench.
2. Add a **10 cm gravel layer**.
3. Place the perforated pipe with holes facing downward.
4. Cover pipe with gravel (20–30 cm).
5. Wrap the geotextile fabric over the top like a burrito.
6. Fill remaining trench with gravel or soil.

#  6. Step 4 — Install Gutters + Downspouts

Shipping container roofs collect a LOT of water.  
Without gutters, all rainwater falls directly at the foundation — causing erosion.

###  Install:
- Gutters on both long sides
- Downspouts that direct water:
  - Into a French drain, or  
  - Into a rain barrel, or  
  - Away from the container (≥ 2 m)

### Steps:
1. Mount gutter brackets along the roofline.
2. Install aluminum or steel gutters.
3. Add downspouts at each end.
4. Connect to drainage pipes or barrels.

#  7. Step 5 — Add a Gravel Bed Under the Container

Even with concrete piers or screw piles, add gravel underneath.

### Recommended:
- **10–20 cm of gravel**
- Spread over entire footprint
- Compact with a plate compactor

This improves drainage and stops weeds and moisture.

#  8. Step 6 — Final Water Flow Check

After everything is installed, test the system.

### Steps:
1. Use a hose or wait for rain.
2. Check that:
   - Water flows *away* from the container
   - No puddles form near the base
   - Trenches move water correctly
   - Gutters drain properly
3. Adjust slopes if needed

#  9. Materials List

| Item | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Shovels / Rakes | Land shaping |
| Mini-excavator (optional) | Fast trenching |
| Plate Compactor | Soil stability |
| Geotextile Fabric | Prevents pipe clogging |
| Crushed Gravel | Main drainage medium |
| Perforated Pipe | Water collection |
| Gutters + Downspouts | Roof water control |
| Level & Laser Level | Slope control |

#  Summary

A proper drainage system includes:

1. Grading land away from the home  
2. A gravel perimeter trench  
3. A French drain (optional but ideal)  
4. Gutters + downspouts  
5. Gravel base under the container  

This ensures your container home lasts decades without water damage.
