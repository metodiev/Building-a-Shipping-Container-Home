Building a Shipping Container Home From Scratch – Introduction

Shipping-container homes have become a popular, modern approach to affordable, durable, and sustainable housing. Their structural strength, modular design, and global availability make them an ideal foundation for custom homebuilding projects—from small off-grid cabins to full-size family residences.

This project documents the complete end-to-end process of building a shipping container home from scratch, including planning, design, budgeting, engineering, fabrication, utilities installation, interior finishing, and long-term maintenance. The goal is to provide a clear, practical, and well-organized reference for anyone interested in turning used shipping containers into a safe, legal, and comfortable living space.

Whether you're a DIY builder, a homesteader, an architect, or simply curious about alternative construction, this repository will guide you through each step with diagrams, notes, checklists, and real-world considerations learned throughout the build.
